    "description": "A robust utility cog for creating 'Modern Modals' with Discord API v10 components. This cog acts as a shared service allowing other cogs to create and await modals containing Select Menus (String, User, Role, Mentionable, Channel) and Text Inputs. It bypasses discord.py validation by making raw API v10 calls with proper component schemas (including required 'label' fields for select menus), providing a clean, Pythonic interface for building complex modals and awaiting user submissions.",
